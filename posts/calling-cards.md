I'm fascinated by the idea of signing your name on something after you finish making it. <br> <br>

Not the ego-centric, "I made this, and I want everyone to know it was me," but more the, "I put my heart and soul into this and want to make sure a part of me will live within this work." <br> <br>

The latter is fascinating. It's caring about something so much that it becomes a part of you. It's caring about something so much that you can't fathom releasing it to the world with no connection to you. <br> <br>

Leaving a mark is common in fine art, music, and other aspects of our lives. Think back to as a kid when we put our handprints in the wet cement on the driveway. We did that for when we left, so a part of us is always there. <br> <br>

That's rooted in care, in sentiment. Often, we don't have these deep connections when making software. We choose to focus on optimization, and yes, we still care, but rarely enough to want to sign our names. <br> <br>

How can we get there? How can we get back to the mentality of the technologists before us who signed their names on the Apple Macintosh? They did so because they put their heart and soul into a product; will we ever feel the same? <br> <br>

There needs to be room for this type of care in making software, and it's our job to champion it; or else we'll stay stuck in this cycle where few things we use ever feel genuine.
